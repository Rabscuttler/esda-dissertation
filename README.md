# Energy Systems and Data Analytics MSc 2018/19 - Dissertation Project

This repository contains an **incomplete** set of notebooks and code from my MSc dissertation project, 'Identifying solar photovoltaic arrays from aerial imagery', supervised by [Professor Paul Ruyssevelt](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/prof-paul-ruyssevelt).

Unfortunately, much underlying data was not open, mostly sourced through Digimap Edina (and so available to academic license holders). **So, these notebooks will not run.**
They are also messy, but may be of some interest to somebody. I may tidy them in future. 

Code for experiments using RasterVision's geospatial ML pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/Rabscuttler/raster-vision/tree/master/code)

The dissertation PDF is the final submitted version (uncorrected), which got a mark of 73 (distinction). 

Slides from a talk on this project from the Edina Geoforum 2020 can be found [here](https://laurence-watson.com/talks/solar_pv/)

Please get in touch if you want to chat about PV detection!

This project was inspired by [Open Climate Fix](https://openclimatefix.org/), a non-profit org who use computers to fight climate change.
